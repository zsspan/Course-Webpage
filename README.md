# CSCB20 Web Design and Databases Course Website!

This course webpage was designed as the final project for the UTSC course CSCB20, introduction to web design and databases. It is a full-stack application using HTML, CSS and JS for the frontend while using Python's Flask and SQLAlchemy as the backend. The app is comprised of many features and uses a serverless SQLite database to store all related course information.
